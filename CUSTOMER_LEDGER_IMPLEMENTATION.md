## üîÑ Data Flow

### Bill Creation with Credit
1. Customer selects existing customer
2. Creates bill with Unpaid/Partial status
3. System automatically creates:
   - Purchase ledger entry (Debit)
   - Payment ledger entry (if partial payment)
4. Updates customer balance
5. Links bill to ledger entries

### Manual Payment Recording
1. Customer makes payment outside of bill creation
2. Shopkeeper adds payment entry to ledger
3. System updates customer balance
4. Transaction history maintained

## üõ°Ô∏è Business Rules

### Customer Management
- Phone numbers must be unique per shopkeeper
- Customers can only be soft deleted (is_active = false)
- Cannot delete customers with pending dues

### Ledger System

- Balance calculation: Previous Balance + Debit - Credit
- Automatic triggers update customer balance on ledger changes

### Bill Integration
- Guest customers: Bills created without customer_id (no ledger tracking)

- Payment status determines ledger entry creation
